        <h2 id="facts-h">Brief facts about <em>Japan</em>:</h2>
        
        <p id="facts-p"> A pretty sad fact about Japan because it’s actually a big problem and there’s a lack of childbirth. The people don’t have time or money to have a family in today’s Japanese Society. And this has led to the situation where there are <em>more seniors than children.</em> Japan is one of the safest countries in the world, so if you worry about crime, you should probably look into moving here. The most common crimes here includes stealing a <strong>bicycle</strong> or <strong>umbrellas</strong> left outside the convenience store.You might know that Japan is an island nation, but did you know that there are more than <strong>6800</strong> islands in Japan? The four biggest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, which together makes up about <strong><em>97%</em> of the total land area.</strong>The festival is known as Kanamara Matsuri, which means something like “the festival for the phallus of steal”. The festival is celebrated in the Japanese city of Kawasaki on the first Sunday in April. In short, just about everything, including candy, vegetables and decorations have the shape of the male reproductive organ or other things related to fertility.

        <h2 id="food-h">Popular food in <em>Japan:</em></h2>
        <p id="food-p">Wonderfully addictive, cultural, and artistic -- sushi remains a mystery to the uninitiated. Why would anyone want to pay so much for a few tidbits of raw fish? Unlike the supermarket sushi slopped out by <em>chains in the West,</em> a true sushi experience is <strong>unforgettable</strong> and <strong>difficult</strong> to recreate. <em>Masters in Japan know how to make each bite a ride of color, texture, taste, and presentation.</em>Although the Japanese get full credit for what we call sushi today, the inspiration for sushi is thought to have started in Southeast Asia. Narezushi, fermented fish wrapped in sour rice, originated somewhere around the Mekong River before spreading into China and later Japan.
