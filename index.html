        Hello my name is Ethan and this is my first <em>Website!</em> I am a student at Plymouth High School and I was born and raised in Indiana. I possess many interests and skills. Some of my favorite intersts include participating in sports, playing videogames, haging out with friends etc. Some of my skills consists of being organized and the ability to be very resilient. Anyays, thats a little bit about me! <br><br>
        
        The <em>sloth</em>. is my spirit animal. Although classified as being lazy and useless, the sloth is the king of chill. Sloths represent calmness, relaxation, saving energy and patience. These strange animals see to make their life comfortable, without asking much. They do not waste their energy and they carefully pick leaves they love to eat and so.<br>
