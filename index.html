        Hi my name is Mr. Fender and I teach computer science at Plymouth High School. I am originally from Texas but my family moved to Colorado when I was in middle school. For high school I went to Culver Military Academy. I taught rocketry and astronomy there over the summer and that is where I met my wife. I graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in physics. I build rockets and robots and love all thing about science and engeneering.<br><br>

        The panda is my spirit animal. The panda is the symbol of love, wisdom, strength, determination, kindness, and flexibility. As a totem animal, pands belong to the group that helps to solve problems and as a power animal have the ability to see all sides of a situation. Plus I think awesome becasue they look cool and they have an extra digit on their paws that can act like a thumb which is not something that most animals have.<br>
