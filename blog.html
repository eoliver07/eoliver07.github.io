            Ah yes, a peacful and relaxing Saturday. I mean that's what weekends are for right? WRONG. Unless you were sick for a whole week, the weekend becomes hectic and stressful. Yes, I took this entire Saturday to get caught up on my website and Khan Academy assignments! Oh how fun that was!(It wasn't...)However Hard work does pay off, so, thats cool! Anyways, another Saturday in the books.

            Friday is crunch time. Work, work work! Today I spent an entire day at school working non-stop. I had a math test today and I hope I passed it. Im usually good at math and I never study so it's always a gamble if I do well on a test or not. Well, atleast I had something to look forward to after a long day. Chicken wings! Mmmmmm yummy chicken.

           Day 2 of da blog. I'm starting to feel like Casey Neistat documenting his life with vlogs, but written down of course. That got me thinking. Do people really care about what my opinion is? Probably not.

            Yay snow day! While I do think that we should have had a snow day Wednesday(2/26), I guess it sheds some light on our super intendant's job to give justice to the buss drivers, parents, and student drivers a makeup day for not cancelling Wednesday. Let's be honest we shouldve cancelled Wednesday because it was even worse today. Anyway, today's a good day to get caught up on all my late work!
