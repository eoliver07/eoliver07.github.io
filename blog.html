      <h4>
        A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people update on a frequent basis, like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new programmers keep blogs to document their journey to becoming a programmer, with updates on what they've learned and what they've made.
      <br><br>
        There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in this project, you'll make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at least 2 entries, and the table of contents should internally link to each entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the font family, line height, and font styles of various sections.
      <br><br>
        Below is my example of what your should have on your own page. Be sure to add links to add a navigation bar and links to all of your other pages!!!

            I forgot that my wife and I were going to go down to Indianapolis today to watch my brother-in-law, Jeremy, compete in a regional NCAA wrestling meet. I have limited wifi here so I wont really be able to make updates, especially to the cookbook. I have pushed some updated stuff live but I will get the rest of the example page up and running later today. Sorry if you are wating for that to start your own pages.

            I wanted to try to get the cookbook live today too but you needy children kept me busy all day. I got the first part of it up and going but there are still a lot of changes I need to make so I don't have it live yet. I hope to get it going tomorrow morning. For now it is 11pm and I am going to get some sleep.

            It is currently 3am and I couldn't sleep anymore so I am playing around on the web a little bit. In class we have been using BBEdit which is a great text editor but unfortunatly it is only available on Macs. I am a pc and linux guy so I am looking for a new program to use and I came across one called <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. It is AWESOME! It has github integrated right into the editor so as you make changes to files and folders you can push them straight to a live branch. It also gives me a little more freedom for settings that are not super important but make writing code a little easier like auto wraping, custom tab spacing, and indent markers.
          <br><br>
            The best part is that it is available for Mac, PC, and Linux so I will have the same program availble to me on all of my computers (which is more rare than you would imagine). I actually started writing this post on my desktop PC then pushed it live. Then I switched over to my laptop that is running Kali linux where I pulled the updates and made some changes to the stylesheet. Then I finished editing this post on my MacBook. "Why?" you ask...because I can!
          <br><br>
            See y'all in class later!

            This is going to be my first example blog post. I am writing this today because it is the first (and probably only) e-learning day for the school year. This has been a rather stange winter. It really has not been too cold and we have not gotten a much snow at all.
          <br><br>
            With my time today I am working on a couple of things. The first was just getting the instructions out for you students so that you know what you are supposed to be working on today. The second is updating these pages. I got a little bored being couped up all day inside so I decided to take the time and really spruce up my pages on this example website so that you can reallt see what you should have for these pages.
          <br><br>
            I started off by just making some updates to my css style sheet. I just wanted to clean things up a little to make it easier for me to use. My home page is already fine so, next I took some time going through and actually writing some information on my travel page and makeing that one work more like I want it too. That one has taken me most of the afternoon to actually come up with some decent paragraphs so I am going to call it quites for now and come back to work on the other pages later.
